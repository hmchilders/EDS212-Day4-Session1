## Session 1: Create some Vectors

```{r}
# Create a vector
rain <- c(3,5,10.1, 6)

# Check the class in the CONSOLE
#class(rain)

#Scalar vector multiplication
3 * rain
# Store the scaled value by using the assignent operator, note storing the scaled value doesnt print the values
rain_scaled <- (5*rain)
```
